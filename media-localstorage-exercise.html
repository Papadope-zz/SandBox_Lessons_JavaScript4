    Exercise: Combining the Media API + Web Storage API (localStorage)
    - Make sure that you store the current frame at which the video is currently at, in the local storage
    - Make sure you store the volume level in local storage
    - When the page loads, the video should load at the point which the user stopped watching, 
    and the volume level should be at the level that was set by the user just before the page reload

    HINTS:
    - The video is ready to be manipulated when the 'loadeddata' event is triggered on the element
    - At what point (event?) can we safely get the current time and store it in localStorage?
    - At what point (event?) can we safely assume that the 'volume' has 'changed' in order to save 
    the volume level to localStorage?
